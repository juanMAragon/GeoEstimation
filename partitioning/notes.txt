> so it reads the dataset_csv_file which contains:
    - image path
    - image latitude
    - image longitude

> sets by default lvl_min=2 and lvl_max=30

> Initializes the cells:
    - it takes the lat and long to retrieve the cell (level=lvl_max)
    - and then retrieves the parent hexid at level=lvl_min.
    - so grouping all the images, hexids and cells in a list
    - it shuffles the list and returns the container + a dictionary
    - the dictionary tells how many images are on a given cell.

> Cell removal:
    - for each parent id having less than t_min images it removes the cell and the images.

> Creation of subcells:
    - starting from level = min_lvl, while level < max_lvl.
    - if there is any cell having more than t_max cells:
    - for each image it gets the cell hexid. if the cell is overbooked then for that image it searches a finer cell (at level=prev_level+1)
    - updates the images->cell distribution.
    - when there are no more overbooked cells or the level cannot be improved it stops

> Cell removal:
    - for each parent id having less than t_min images it removes the cell and the images.
